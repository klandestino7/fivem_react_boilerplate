# React UI Boilerplate for FiveM / RedM

This is a simple and modular boilerplate for integrating React-based UIs in FiveM or RedM projects. It allows easy communication between your game scripts and a React frontend via NUI messages and route handling.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- React frontend with NUI integration
- Route-based message handling (`UIRoutes`)
- Built-in command to open the UI (`/openui`)
- Simple and clean structure for expansion

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

This boilerplate uses `RegisterNUICallback` to route messages sent from React to Lua handlers using a route map (`UIRoutes`).

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo or copy the boilerplate files to your resource folder.
2. Set up your React frontend inside the `ui` folder (or as configured).
3. Build your React app and copy the output to the correct NUI path.
4. Start your resource in `server.cfg`.
5. Use `/openui` in-game to open the interface.

---

## ðŸ§© Tips

* Add new routes to the `UIRoutes` table to handle more interactions.
* Use `fetchNui(route, data)` in React to communicate with Lua.
* Always include a `route` key in your NUI messages for proper routing.
